# Calendar.js (Work In Progress)
Pure JS calendar library
## Motivation
I needed a date-picker component for a VueJS project, and I found it! But, one has too many dependencies, and the styles of others are too coupled with Bootstrap or Material Design or whatever.

So I started by doing a simple calendar using MomentJS. By doing it I realized that a date-picker is a calendar with the option of selecting a date. With that in mind I realized that we need to calculate some things to render a calendar, like, the days in that month, in what weekday is the first and the last day, wich weekdays are empty in that month, etc. Then I concluded:

> We can have a general library that calculates these things so we only need to render these information in any framework

Thatâ€™s my goal.
